It was fun a bit in a rush since was a hard week, but thanks again and looking forward to your feedback.

I focused on the frontend building the whole logic in React,  Reasons?
well, we can discussed this later.
(but yeah you won't find any magic in the express app)


Oh yeah but first! let me tell you how to start the engine!

- git
- node "8.9.4" _(minimum)_
- And I would recommend definitely a beer.

## Install the Stuff

one command to rule them all:
  >yarn start
